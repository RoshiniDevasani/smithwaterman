# Smith Waterman Algorithm and Needleman Wunsch Algorithm
**Overview**
This C++ program utilizes the Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch algorithm to compare Protein Data Bank (PDB) files of amino acids. The algorithm is applied to compare PDB1 with PDB2 to identify the highest match and to compare PDB1 with PDB3 to identify the least match.

**Create a New Project:**

Open Visual Studio.
Go to File > New > Project....
Choose Visual C++ and then Empty Project.
Name your project and choose a location.
Click OK to create the empty project.

**Writing Code:**

Double-click on the newly created file within the Solution Explorer to open it in the editor.
Write or paste your C++ code implementing the Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch algorithm or any other desired functionality into this file.

This code includes a basic Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch algorithm and a main function that reads command-line arguments for three PDB file names and calls the Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch algorithm function with these file names.

Customize the Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch algorithm function according to your comparison logic based on the Smith Waterman and Needleman Wunsch algorithm.

**Output**
The program will output the comparison results:
Highest match between PDB1 and PDB2.
Least match between PDB1 and PDB3.

**Note**
Ensure that the PDB files are correctly formatted and contain the necessary data for comparison.
This program assumes valid PDB file inputs.
